			<em>They are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.</em>
			A few kennels breeding their ancestors, the <a id="water dog" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_water_dog">St. John's water dog</a>, were in <span id="England"> England</span>. 
			At the same time, a combination of the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and rabies quarantine in the <abbr id="England" title="United Kingdom" aria-label="United Kingdom">U.K.</abbr>, led to the gradual demise of the <span id="water dog">St. John's water dog</span> in Canada.
			In the <time>1830s</time>, the <a id="person" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Home,_10th_Earl_of_Home">10th Earl of Home</a> and his nephews the <a id="person" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Montagu_Douglas_Scott,_5th_Duke_of_Buccleuch">5th Duke of Buccleuch</a> and <a id="person" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_John_Scott">Lord John Scott</a>, had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as <span id="gun dog">gundogs</span>. 
			Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris,_2nd_Earl_of_Malmesbury">2nd Earl of Malmesbury</a> who bred them for their expertise in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl_hunting">waterfowling</a></em>.
			During the <time>1880s</time>, the <a id="person" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris,_3rd_Earl_of_Malmesbury">3rd Earl of Malmesbury</a>, the <a id="person" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Montagu_Douglas_Scott,_6th_Duke_of_Buccleuch">6th Duke of Buccleuch</a> and the <a id="person" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Douglas-Home,_12th_Earl_of_Home">12th Earl of Home</a> collaborated to develop and establish the modern Labrador breed. 
			The dogs <em>Buccleuch Avon</em> and <em>Buccleuch Ned</em>, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. 
			<em>The offspring are considered to be the ancestors of modern Labradors</em>.
