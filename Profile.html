			<h1>Profile</h1>

		<h2>Appearance</h2>
			<p>
				Labradors are medium-large, with males typically weighing 65–80 lb (29–36 kg) and females 55–70 lb (25–32 kg). 
				The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of color, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever.
			</p>
			<p>
				As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and the Field (typically "Working" or "American") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries. 
				In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. 
				However, Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within American Kennel Club standards. 
				With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs, and lanky frames are not considered standard. 
				These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. 
				Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they are common in Asia. 
				These dogs are also very good with children.
			</p>
			<p>
				The breed tends to shed hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in temperate climates. 
				Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary. Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. 
				The webbed toes of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a "snowshoe" in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes—a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.
			</p>
		<h2>Official breed standards</h2>
			<p>
				There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. 
				The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard. 
				Significant differences between UK and US standards are noted.
			</p>
			<dl>
				<p>
				<b><dt>Size:</dt></b>
					<dd>
					Labradors are a medium-large breed. 
					They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. 
					The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for males of 65–80 lb (29–36 kg) and for females as 55–70 lb (25–32 kg). 
					The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 22.5 to 24.5 inches (57 to 62 cm) for males and 21.5 to 23.5 inches (55 to 60 cm) for females, whereas The Kennel Club advise males should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22 in) with females between 55 to 56 centimetres (22 to 22 in) and the FCI quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22 in) for males with females ideal at 54 to 56 centimetres (21 to 22 in).
					</dd>
				</p>
				<p>
				<b><dt>Coat:</dt></b>
					<dd>
					The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. 
					The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. 
					That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. 
					Acceptable colors are black, yellow, and chocolate.
					</dd>
				</p>
				<p>
				<b><dt>Head:</dt></b>
					<dd>
					The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. 
					The eyes should be kind and expressive. 
					Appropriate eye colors are brown and hazel. 
					The lining around the eyes should be black. 
					The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes. 
					</dd>
				</p>
				<p>
				<b><dt>Jaws:</dt></b>
					<dd>
					The jaws should be strong and powerful. 
					The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. 
					The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back. 
					</dd>
				</p>
				<p>
				<b><dt>Body:</dt></b>
					<dd>
					The body should have a powerful and muscular build. 
					The tail and coat are designated "distinctive [or distinguishing] features" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC. 
					The AKC adds that "true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail."
					</dd>
				</p>
		<h2>Color</h2>
			<p>
			<h3>Nose and skin pigmentation</h3>
				<p>
					Labrador coloration is controlled by multiple genes. 
					It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. 
					Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to different parts of the body. 
					Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. 
					The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colors. 
					A Labrador can carry genes for a different color, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colors. 
					DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. 
					Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.
				</p>
				<p>
					The intensity of black pigment on yellow Labradors is controlled by a separate gene independent of the fur coloring. 
					Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called "snow nose" or "winter nose"). 
					This is due to a reduction in the enzyme tyrosinase which indirectly controls the production of melanin, a dark coloring. 
					Tyrosinase is temperature dependent—hence light coloration can be seasonal, due to cold weather—and is less produced with increasing age two years old onwards. 
					As a result, the nose color of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.
				</p>
				<p>
					A coloration known as "Dudley" is also possible. 
					Dudleys are variously defined as yellow Labradors which have unpigmented (pink) noses (LRC), yellow with liver/chocolate pigmentation (AKC), or "flesh colored" in addition to having the same color around the rims of the eye, rather than having black or dark brown pigmentation. 
					A yellow Labrador with brown or chocolate pigmentation, for example, a brown or chocolate nose, is not necessarily a Dudley, though according to the AKC's current standard it would be if it has chocolate rims around the eyes (or more accurately of the genotype eebb). 
					Breed standards for Labradors considers a true Dudley to be a disqualifying feature in a conformation show Lab, such as one with a thoroughly pink nose or one lacking in any pigment along with flesh colored rims around the eyes. 
					True Dudleys are extremely rare. 
					Breeding in order to correct pigmentation often lacks dependability. 
					Because color is determined by many genes, some of which are recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. 
					For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.
