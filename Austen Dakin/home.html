			Hello, my name is Austen Dakin and I created this website. 
			Feel free to look around, but my main goal is for you to see the kind of work that I do. 
			I desire to start my own business in website development. 
			Please fee free to contact me and I look forward to hearing from you!
		</p>
		<p>
			All glory goes to God. Everything I do, I do it for Him. 
			All the talent I have is only because God wants me to be able to share my work with others to create a Godly community and to allow His glory to shine through the work that He has me do. 
			If you need any more information, I will be posting a blog on this website which will explore the different ideas of God. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for checking my business out, and I hope to hear from you soon! 
		</p>
		<p>
			DISCLAIMER: not an actual business, I am creating this page as a template for a future business. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Blessings, <br>Austen Dakin
