			Labrador pups generally are not brought to the home before they are 8 weeks old. 
			Their life expectancy is generally 10 to 12 years, and it is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. 
			Notable issues related to health and well-being include:
		</p></main>
		<h2>Inherrited Disorders</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>
				Labradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, especially the larger dogs. 
				though not as much as some other breeds. 
				Hip scores are recommended before breeding and often joint supplements are recommended. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Labradors also suffer from the risk of knee problems. 
				A luxating patella is a common occurrence in the knee where the knee dislocates and goes back into place. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Eye problems are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. 
				Dogs which are intended to be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Hereditary myopathy, a rare inherited disorder that causes a deficiency in type II muscle fibre. 
				Symptoms include a short stilted gait or "bunny hopping," and in rare cases ventroflexion of the neck accompanied by a kyphotic posture.
			</li>
			<li>
				There is a small incidence of other conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and deafness in Labradors, either congenitally or later in life.
			<li>
				Labradors often suffer from exercise induced collapse, a syndrome that causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise.
			</li>
			<li>
				Out of all dog breeds it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to obese. This obesity has been attributed to a specific gene mutation. See the Obesity sub section below. 
			</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Obesity</h2>
		<p>
			Labradors like to eat, and without proper exercise can become obese. 
			Laziness is a contribution to this. 
			Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. 
			A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. 
			Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. 
			A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. 
			Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, and can lead to secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very uncommon in older, especially overweight, Labradors. 
			A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. 
			Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.
		</p>
		<p>
			It has been shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to be obese. 
			In a 2016 published study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. 
			This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. 
			The study concluded that the absence of that gene had a significant impact on Labrador weight and appetite. 
			The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed - the Flat-coated Retriever.
